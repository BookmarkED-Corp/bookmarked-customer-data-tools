## Notes for Development

### Parallel Work Opportunities
These tasks can be worked on in parallel after their dependencies are met:

**After Phase 1 Foundation:**
- TASK-011 and TASK-012 (tools)
- TASK-013 and TASK-014 (connectors)

**After Phase 2 Core:**
- TASK-021 and TASK-022 (advanced tools)
- TASK-023 + TASK-024 (HubSpot)

**After Phase 3 Features:**
- TASK-032, TASK-033, TASK-034 (AWS infrastructure)

### Human Tasks
Two tasks require human involvement:
- **TASK-038**: User guide and training materials (needs domain knowledge)
- **TASK-039**: Security audit and penetration testing (needs security expertise)

These should be scheduled appropriately with domain experts.

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: TASK-020 (after Phase 2)
- Integration tests: TASK-030 (after Phase 3)
- E2E tests: TASK-036 (before deployment)
- Security audit: TASK-039 (before production)

## Next Steps

1. Review this task breakdown with stakeholders
2. Assign tasks to sprints based on team capacity
3. Begin with TASK-001 (Flask application setup)
4. Use Kanban board for visual task tracking
5. Update task status as work progresses

**Kanban Board UI:** Run `node kanban_server.js` and visit http://localhost:3000
