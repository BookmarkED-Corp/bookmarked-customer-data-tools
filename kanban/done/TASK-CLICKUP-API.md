## Description
Implement ClickUp API integration for project management and task tracking functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Created ClickUp connector in `src/connectors/clickup.py`
- [x] Full API support for teams, spaces, lists, and tasks
- [x] Connection testing endpoint at `/api/connections/test/clickup`
- [x] UI section added to connections setup page
- [x] API key storage with encryption
- [x] Comprehensive test suite created
- [x] Task CRUD operations (create, update, comment)
- [x] Error handling and logging implemented

## Implementation Details

**ClickUp Connector Features:**
- Connection testing with user info retrieval
- Teams/workspaces management
- Spaces, lists, and tasks operations  
- Task creation, updates, and comments
- Comprehensive error handling

**API Methods:**
- `test_connection()` - Verify API key and get user info
- `get_teams()` - List all teams/workspaces
- `get_spaces()` - Get spaces in a team
- `get_lists()` - Get lists in a space
- `get_tasks()` - Get tasks in a list
- `get_task()` - Get specific task by ID
- `create_task()` - Create new task
- `update_task()` - Update existing task
- `add_comment()` - Add comment to task

**Test Coverage:**
- 15+ test cases covering all functionality
- Connection success/failure scenarios
- Data retrieval operations
- Task operations (marked as integration tests)
- Error handling and timeouts

**Verified:**
- Connection test passed with real API key
- User info retrieved: Ryan Gallagher (ID: 81574061)
- Integration with connections management system

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/connectors/clickup.py` (new - 442 lines)
- `src/routes/connections.py` (updated - added ClickUp endpoints)
- `src/templates/connections/setup.html` (updated - added ClickUp section)
- `tests/test_connectors/test_clickup.py` (new - 306 lines)
- `tests/test_connectors/test_classlink.py` (new - 237 lines)

## Notes
- Uses API key authentication (simpler than OAuth for this use case)
- All API keys encrypted when saved to config
- Comprehensive logging with structlog
- Integration tests separated with pytest marks
