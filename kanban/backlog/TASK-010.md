## Description
Create REST API client for Bookmarked backend API supporting both staging and production environments. Implement connection pooling, retry logic, and common API methods.

- [ ] Support for staging and production API URLs
- [ ] Authentication with API credentials
- [ ] Methods implemented: `get_students()`, `get_classes()`, `get_enrollments()`, `get_organizations()`
- [ ] Keep-alive connections for performance
- [ ] Retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Request timeout set to 30 seconds
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation
- [ ] Error handling for API failures
- [ ] Response caching for repeated requests (5 minutes)

## Dependencies
- TASK-001
- TASK-008

## Notes
- Use requests library with session pooling
- Log all API calls for debugging
- Handle API versioning if needed
- Consider pagination for large result sets
